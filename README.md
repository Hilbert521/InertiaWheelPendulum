The Inertia Wheel Pendulum is an Undergraduate project that my friend Edwin van Emmerik and I conducted during our Minor at Saxion Enschede, 'Robotics and Computer Vision'

The Project consists of:
1. A report.
2. A python State-Space simulation of the system.
3. A physical system that we designed the controllers for.

The Report and the Python simulation can be found in this repository.
